#Features:
1)AI Integration: The AI opponent uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal decisions.

2)Efficient Gameplay: Optimized decision-making ensures the game runs smoothly with quick responses from the AI.

3)Customizable Code: Modify the AI or game rules to explore different strategies and variations of Connect 4.

#Prerequisites:

Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it here.

#How to Play

#Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sukhadak11/Connect4_AI_Game

#Navigate to the project directory:
cd Connect4_AI_Game

#Run the game:
python3 Connect4.py
Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to play against the AI.
#How It Works
*Minimax Algorithm: The AI evaluates all possible moves and selects the best one to maximize its chances of winning.

*Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by reducing the number of nodes evaluated, ensuring efficient gameplay.

#Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface for a more interactive experience.
Implement different AI difficulty levels.
Include a multiplayer mode to play with friends.
